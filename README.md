# arithmeticgame

A game where you generate a few random numbers and try to use these random numbers to create a random total using specific mathematical operations. Enjoy!


Things I will try to add - 
1. A GUI
2. A Solution class with a different equals method in order to accurately compare solutions rather than have repeats
3. Fix the hard coding for the number of cards, so that the number of cards can be arbitrary
4. Adding more operations, and the option to choose which ones to play with
